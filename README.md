Labs that I wrote for 3010m - Advanced Research Methods, special section, neural recording and signal processing in MATLAB.

Wrote the content, and ran the lab section of the classes. 

This class was geared towards Psychology students, with no previous programming experience. 

Included is a highlight of some of my favorite classes. Goal is to include all labs in the public repo for those learning MATLAB.
